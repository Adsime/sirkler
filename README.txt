#Third android project.

##Important: 
This app was made in a few days. There are some bugs which will make the app crash when freshly loading a list. I am aware of the quality poor quality of this code. 

Goal was to learn how to code against an API and process Json data.
I also set myself a goal to use fragments properly.
